# FTM-400XDR-exports
Copies of my Yaesu FTM-400XDR amateur radio frequency tables, exported from the RTSystems software.

BAND-A:
- NOAA WX Frequencies
- APRS
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequencies
- My local club's normal event simplex frequency
- VHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- UHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- VHF & UHF Repeaters in areas of NH, FL, MA, and MI, where I often visit.
- Several popular FM Satellites, and the International Space Station

BAND-B:
- NOAA WX Frequencies
- APRS
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequencies
- My local club's normal event simplex frequency
- FRS Frequencies
- GMRS Frequencies
- MURS Frequencies
- Business Itinerent Frequencies
- Aviation-related frequencies (including the Goodyear Blimp, Kent State University Airport, Akron Municipal Airport, Akron-Canton Regional Airport, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, and General Aviation AM & FM Frequencies)
- VHF Marine Frequencies
- North American Railroad Frequencies
- 220MHz Band (1.25 Meter) Simplex and Northeast Ohio Repeater frequencies

Entries 1 through 100 are identical in the BAND-A and BAND-B lists.  This was done partly to speed the initial setup, but mainly to ensure that channel numbers were consistent between the "bands", for those simplex frequencies I could transmit on.  (Yes, I know that only BAND-B can do APRS, and that only BAND-A can do digital.)  From entry 101 onward, each "band" goes off in different directions.

BAND-A contains Amateur Radio frequencies that I can legally transmit on, with an unmodified FTM-400XDR radio (eg: repeaters and FM satellites).  BAND-B includes frequencies (and modes) of interest that an unmodified FTM-400XDR can receive, but can not transmit on.  As a retired Coast Guard Avionicsman (HH-3F helicopters), I have an interest in both VHF Marine, and Aviation traffic.  I also have a fascination with trains, hence the Railroad frequencies.  And finally, the 220MHz (1.25 Meter) frequencies are here on BAND-B just for listening, as the radio cannot transmit on 1.25 Meters.

As I am located in the Akron area of Northeast Ohio, USA, many of the frequencies (such as the airports and repeaters in the surrounding counties) are relevant only to this area.  The "comments" columns in the files should adequately describe everything here, should you want to help yourself to any pieces/parts of these files.

The satellite info in BAND-A very likely has errors, as I am just researching them.  Do not assume they are correct, without eye-balling them, first.
