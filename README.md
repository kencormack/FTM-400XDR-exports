# FTM-400XDR-exports
Copies of my Yaesu FTM-400XDR amateur radio frequency tables, exported from the RTSystems software.

BAND-A:
- NOAA WX Frequencies
- APRS
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequency
- My local club's typically used event simplex frequency
- VHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- UHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- VHF & UHF Repeaters in areas of NH, FL, MA, and MI, where I often visit.
- FM Satellites: AO27, IO86, ISSTV, ISS (repeater), ISS (talk to the astronauts), LILAC2, and SO50

BAND-B:
- NOAA WX Frequencies
- APRS
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequency
- My local club's typically used event simplex frequency
- FRS Frequencies
- GMRS Frequencies
- MURS Frequencies
- Business Itinerent Frequencies
- Aviation-related frequencies (including the Goodyear Blimp, Kent State University Airport, Akron Municipal Airport, Akron-Canton Regional Airport, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, and General Aviation AM & FM Frequencies)
- VHF Marine Frequencies
- North American Railroad Frequencies
- 220MHz Band (1.25 Meter) Simplex and Northeast Ohio Repeater frequencies

As I am located in the Akron area of Northeast Ohio, USA, several of the frequencies (such as the airports and repeaters in the surrounding counties) are relevant only to this area.  The "comments" columns in the files should adequately describe everything here, should you want to help yourself to any pieces/parts of these files.

The satellite info in "BAND A" very likely has errors, as I am just researching them.  Do not assume they are correct, without eye-balling them, first.
