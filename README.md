# FTM-400XDR-exports
Copies of my Yaesu FTM-400XDR amateur radio frequency tables, exported from the RTSystems software.

**BAND-A:**
- NOAA WX Frequencies, and Canada's Continuous Marine Broadcast Frequencies
- APRS ######(Here For Reference Only - BAND A doesn't do APRS)######
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequencies
- My local club's normal event simplex frequencies
- VHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- UHF Repeaters in the Summit, Portage, Stark, Cuyahoga, and Tuscarawas counties of Ohio
- VHF & UHF Repeaters in areas of NH, FL, MA, and MI, where I often visit.
- Several popular FM Satellites, and the International Space Station

**BAND-B:**
- NOAA WX Frequencies, and Canada's Continuous Marine Broadcast Frequencies
- APRS
- VHF & UHF Digital Simplex Frequencies proposed by Yaesu ######(Here for Reference Only - BAND B doesn't do digital)######
- VHF Simplex Frequencies (Consult your area's Frequency Coordinator)
- UHF Simplex Frequencies
- My local club's normal event simplex frequencies
- FRS Frequencies
- GMRS Frequencies
- MURS Frequencies
- Business Itinerent Frequencies
- Aviation-related frequencies (including the Goodyear Blimp, Kent State University Airport, Akron-Fulton Municipal Airport, Akron-Canton Regional Airport, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, and General Aviation AM & FM Frequencies)
- VHF Marine Frequencies
- North American Railroad Frequencies
- 220MHz Band (1.25 Meter) Simplex and Northeast Ohio Repeater frequencies

**Entries 1 through 102 are identical in the BAND-A and BAND-B lists.  This was done partly to speed the initial setup, but mainly to ensure that channel numbers were consistent between the "bands", for those simplex frequencies I could transmit on.  (Yes, I know that only BAND-B can do APRS, and that only BAND-A can do digital.)**

From entry 103 onward, each "band" goes off in different directions.  BAND-A contains Amateur Radio frequencies that I can legally transmit on, with an unmodified FTM-400XDR radio and suitable antenna (eg: repeaters and FM satellites).  BAND-B includes frequencies (and modes) of interest that an unmodified FTM-400XDR can receive, but can not transmit on.  As a retired Coast Guard Avionicsman (HH-3F helicopters), I have an interest in both Aviation traffic, and VHF Marine traffic on the Great Lakes (and coastal areas of New England and Florida when I travel).  I also have a fascination with trains, hence the Railroad frequencies.  Lastly, the 220MHz (1.25 Meter) frequencies are here on BAND-B just for listening, as the radio cannot transmit on 1.25 Meters.

My QTH is the Akron area of Northeast Ohio, USA.  Many of the frequencies (ie: the airports and repeaters in the surrounding counties) are relevant only to this area.  The "comments" columns in the files describe everything, should you want to help yourself to any pieces/parts of these files.

With Akron, OH being the home of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., one of their blimps is home-ported here, at Wingfoot Lake.  The other two are based out of Pompano Beach, FL and Carson, CA.  The blimp closest to an event (such as NFL football games) is sent to provide aerial television coverage.  The frequencies included here have been observed between the individual blimps and their TV and support ground crews, at these events.  Their coresponding callsigns are:
- Wingfoot One (N1A), based in Pompano Beach Airpark in Pompano Beach, Florida
- Wingfoot Two (N2A), based in Goodyear Blimp Base Airport in Carson, California
- Wingfoot Three (N3A), based in Wingfoot Lake Airship Operations Balloonport in Suffield, Ohio

The satellite info in BAND-A likely has errors, as I am just researching them.  Do not assume they are correct, without eye-balling them, first.
